## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The team hopes to discover the distribution of happiness levels across the globe. We may then find the reason for the distribution with the available attributes given. It is really interesting to analyze the Worls Happiness Report because there are many countries with higher and lower level of happiness than the ones we live in. Furthermore, it provides good insight to cultural, governmental, and economy differences in different parts of the world. It would be neat to find out if what other countries could do to improve the happiness of its citezens.
Some questions the team would like to explore include the following: Which country is the happiest? Which country is the least happiest? Why are these countries happy/unhappy? Which factor is most correlated with an increase in a country's happiness? How can the team visualize the data?
The team can imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with using this dataset. Information such as social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, corruption would be ideal to graph visually.
